I'm working on my PhD part-time at the University of Granada in Spain, studying how to operationalise fairness in automatic decision systems. I also spent some time at the University of Bergen in Norway to learn more and share ideas.

I got my master's degree in Computer Science and have been teaching and researching in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) for five years at the Central University "Marta Abreu" of Las Villas in Cuba. But I donâ€™t just stay in the classroom or lab; I've also worked with companies to use data and AI to help them work better and make smarter decisions.

Right now, I'm working with the Spanish Association of the Digital Economy in the [algorithmic transparency certificate](https://www.algorithmictransparency.io/). Plus, I've been chosen to help lead a discussion group for the European Student Assembly in 2024.
